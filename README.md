McDonald’s Website Clone
This project is a responsive McDonald’s website clone created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the look and feel of the official McDonald’s homepage. The goal of this project is to practice front-end web development skills by designing a visually accurate layout with structured sections and interactive elements.

The website includes a navigation bar with menu links and an “Order Now” button, a hero banner highlighting promotional offers, and multiple meal showcase sections displaying featured products with images, descriptions, and call-to-action buttons. High-quality food images are used to enhance visual appeal and create a realistic brand experience.

The layout is styled using custom CSS to closely match McDonald’s branding, including color schemes, typography, spacing, and responsive alignment. JavaScript is used to support basic interactivity and future extensibility. The project also contains a detailed footer section with multiple columns such as About Us, Services, Community, and Contact, similar to a real commercial website.

This project demonstrates my understanding of HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and frontend page layout, making it a strong example of a static website clone built for learning and practice purposes.
